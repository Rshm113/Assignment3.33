COMPONENTS OF HADOOP
HDFS : Hadoop distributed file system(HDFS) is a storage system in the hadoop 2.x. This storage system has high capacity of about 5 petabyte.
This hdfs stores the file in block formate each block has a storage capacity of 128 mb. This also provide replication service so tha dadat cannot be lost.
Each system has replication factor of 3.HDFS comprises of 3 important components-NameNode, DataNode and Secondary NameNode. HDFS operates on a Master-Slave
architecture model where the NameNode acts as the master node for keeping a track of the storage cluster and the DataNode acts as a slave node summing up to 
the various systems within a Hadoop cluster.

Map Reduce:Map reduce is the place where the stored data is processed. MapReduce breaks down a big data processing job into smaller tasks. MapReduce is responsible 
for the analysing large datasets in parallel before reducing it to find the results. In the Hadoop ecosystem, Hadoop MapReduce is a framework based on YARN architecture. 
YARN based Hadoop architecture, supports parallel processing of huge data sets and MapReduce provides the framework for easily writing applications on thousands of nodes, 
considering fault and failure management.
